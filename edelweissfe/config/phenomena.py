# field                  kind of inertia
#
# The coefficient of a field's SECOND time derivative is not always a mass. A dynamic solver
# assembles one inertia vector over every field alike -- the integrator divides by all of it --
# but reporting a momentum or an energy needs to know which entries may be added to which. This
# is the only place that question is answered:
#
#  * ``"mass"``               -- m*v is a linear momentum, 0.5*m*v^2 an energy; summable with
#                                every other mass field in both balances.
#  * ``"rotational inertia"`` -- 0.5*I*w^2 is an energy, but I*w is an ANGULAR momentum and must
#                                not be added to a linear one. No dimension check catches that:
#                                in 3d both occupy three components.
#  * ``"non-mechanical"``     -- neither. Typically a numerical regularisation: the non-local
#                                micro-inertia is a time squared, so 0.5*m*v^2 there is a volume.
#
# A field with no inertia at all is recorded as ``"non-mechanical"`` too -- the question is what
# its inertia WOULD mean, and it has none to sum anywhere.
